## Project Overview

**NASA Web Apps Orrery 2024** is a web-based simulation of the solar system that visualizes the movement of planets and celestial objects around the sun. The application uses interactive elements and animations to depict planetary orbits, rotational motion, and realistic cosmic effects like stars, star tails, and celestial bodies.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in astronomy, web development, and those looking to explore how the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can create immersive and dynamic visualizations.

## Features

- **Realistic Simulation**: Displays the motion of planets in a highly accurate representation.
- **Interactive Audio**: Users can play/pause background cosmic music for an enhanced experience.
- **Stylish Animations**: Stars, star tails, planets, and other celestial bodies have custom animations.
- **SVG Filters**: Custom visual effects like turbulence and color matrix filters applied to simulate stars and planetary structures.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts well to different screen sizes.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](#). (Add link when available)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the simulation.
- **CSS**: For visual styles, animations, and filters.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic behavior and audio controls.

## Setup and Installation

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azstar0619/nasa-webapps-orrery-2024.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd nasa-webapps-orrery-2024

3. **Open index.html in your browser**:

   ```bash
   You can open index.html directly in a browser to view the orrery simulation.

### Optional: Use a Live Server:
   For a better development experience, use a live server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code).

## Setup and Installation

- **Viewing the Orrery: Open the project in a web browser to view the planetary movements.**
- **Interact with the Solar System: The simulation automatically displays the planets in motion.**
